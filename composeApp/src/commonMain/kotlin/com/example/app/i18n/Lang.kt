 * The languages the app is written in.
 *
 * A closed enum rather than an open locale tag: every string the app owns exists in exactly these
 * three, guaranteed by [Strings] being an interface — a language added here does not compile until
 * its table is complete. Anything the *server* writes (an inbox row's badge and facts, an activity
 * type's label, a run's summary) is untouched by this and stays in whatever language the server
 * speaks; see the note in [Strings].
 *
 * [tag] is the BCP-47 primary subtag, which is what `UserAP.locale` stores and what [fromTag] maps
 * back. [nativeName] is how the language names itself — a language picker written in the language
 * the reader is trying to leave is useless.
